# MapFind

Pretty much every link in the encyclopedia will now bring you to a settlement if you shift-click on it.

When it's a hero, clan or kingdom link, it shows the last-known location of the person or leader.

You can also navigate the world map by shift-clicking on the nameplates.  Ctrl-shift-click will force the camera to stay still.
